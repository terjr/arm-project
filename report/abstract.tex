\begin{abstract}

This paper investigates the instruction level energy efficency of an Cortex-A9,
and presents numbers on energy comsumption pr. instruction.  The investigation
shows that even though the ARM Cortex-A9 is a computationaly strong and energy
efficient CPU, there are room for improvements.
