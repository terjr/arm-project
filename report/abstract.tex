\begin{abstract}

This paper investigates the instruction level energy efficiency of an Cortex-A9,
and presents numbers on energy consumption pr. instruction. The investigation
shows that even though the ARM Cortex-A9 is a computationally strong and energy
efficient CPU, there are room for improvements.
