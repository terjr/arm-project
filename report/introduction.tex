\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{odays} processors grow more sophisticated each day, and
more and more advanced features are added. In the earlier days, the focus
was all on performance, but as we are hitting walls where we cannot dispatch
more heat, along with computers entring smaller and more energy aware domains,
power and energy has become a major focal point.

In this paper, we present a method for analysing the instruction level energy efficency
of a new computer architecture. We also apply this method to the ARM Cortex-A9, and
inspect the power profile of different instructions. We will see that even though
the ARM Cortex-A9 is both a computationaly strong and energy efficient CPU, there
are room for improvement.


What exactly have we been focusing on? Reverse-engineered the ARM Cortex-A9. ARM
does not even tell how many functional units there is in the A9 core. With these
results, we have been able to normalize power consumption per instruction,
eliminating energy usage caused by the memory hierarchy.

We are still treating the A9 core as a black box.
