\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{odays} processors grow more sophisticated each day, and more
and more advanced features are added. In the earlier days, the focus was all on
performance, but current research are hitting walls where we cannot dispatch more heat.
Along with computers entering smaller and more energy aware domains, power and
energy has become a major focal point\cite{patterson}\cite{hennessy}.

In this paper, we present a method for analysing the instruction level energy
efficency of a new computer architecture. We take commonly used
microarchitecture features, like out-of-order execution and dual-issue, into
account in order to isolate the functional unit's energy consumption.

In our case study, we apply our method to an ARM Cortex-A9, a modern 32-bit
processor implementing the ARMv7 instruction set. We inspect the power profile
of various instructions and see that even though the ARM Cortex-A9 is both a
computationaly strong and energy efficient CPU, there are room for energy
improvements.

\todo[inline]{SHMAC}
Our research is highly motivated by the SHMAC project from the Energy Efficient
Computin Systems research group at NTNU. SHMAC is The Single-ISA Heterogeneous
MAny-core Computer where one of the main goals is an optimal processor in terms
of energy efficency. The SHMAC processor is based on the Amber open-source ARM
compatible processor core project. Our research on the ARM Cortex A9
based Exynos 4212 will of course not be equal to the same experiments run on
a final implementation of SHMAC, but it will give concrete results for a near
ISA-equivalent chip.


\todo[inline]{What exactly have we been focusing on? Reverse-engineered the ARM
    Cortex-A9. ARM does not even tell how many functional units there is in the
    A9 core. With these results, we have been able to normalize power
    consumption per instruction, eliminating energy usage caused by the memory
    hierarchy. We are still treating the A9 core as a black box.}
