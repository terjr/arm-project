\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{M}{oore's} law is very often the first word in a paper about computer science.
This is in fact a paper about computer science, and thus starts with the words Moore's law.

What exactly have we been focusing on? Reverse-engineered the ARM Cortex-A9. ARM
does not even tell how many functional units there is in the A9 core. With these
results, we have been able to normalize power consumption per instruction,
eliminating energy usage caused by the memory hierarchy.

We are still treating the A9 core as a black box.
