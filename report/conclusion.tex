\section{Conclusion}
We have explored the inner workings of the ARM Cortex-A9 processor core and
measured energy consumptions for various instructions. We found that the energy
consumption for simple single-cycle instructions are rather equal. This RISC
processor also includes a range of more advanced instructions that needs more
than a single cycle to complete. We have looked into all multi-cycle
instructions related to multiply and multiply-accumulate, along with a few
register level data movement instructions.

Our main observation is that those instructions that are unable to fully fill
the pipelines comes out as more energy efficient on the current readings. This
is most likely because near empty pipeline consume less energy than a full
pipeline. We must emphasize that these instructions are not more energy
efficient than their counterparts, only slower in producing their intended
results. Apart from this, the numbers tell that the most efficient instructions
are \texttt{sub} and \texttt{add}, followed by common logical functions. This
is expected as all these instruction are both easily implemented and commonly
used.

It is also seen that the instructions executing conditionally and those settings
status flags are subject to a less efficient instruction dispatching. We assume
that synchronization is needed for this kind of instructions. Conditional
executing is most likely better idea in a simple in-order CPU than in advanced
out-of-order CPU cores. We also notice that instructions that should not be
committed is issued, executed and then discarded.

For the multi-cycle instructions, we observed that even though the processor
datasheet\cite{armtech} states a number of cycles for each instruction to
complete its result, different pipelining schemes apply to the different
instructions. Multiply can only be done in the main execution unit, while
accumulate is seemingly executed in the second pipeline. This means that even
though \texttt{mul} introduces queueing for access to the main pipeline,
multiply-accumulate (\texttt{mla}), is equally fast, see
\autoref{tab:perf_mul}.

%Observations (regarding this architecture):
%Status flag update instructions are cheaper than their non-updating counterpart.
%Energy consumption is generally dominated by instruction cycle count.
%The results are stable (when doing multiple runs, each runs compare well with
%        previous ones)
%
%Our measures of the multiply and other serializing instructions should probably
%be checked more into, as the performance co:e unters in \autoref{tab:perf_mul} and
%\autoref{tab:perf_nonmul} shows different degree of idleness over the different
%instructions, even though we have tried to avoid this.  This is probably a
%matter of rewriting the kernel modules used for instruction testing, and we
%simply had no more time investigating this matter.
%
%Our final conclusion would be that the ARM Cortex-A9 is a processor core that
%seems to be well balanced in terms of energy consumption over each instruction,
%and there are no enormeous peaks or spikes in our measurements. It seems to be
%serialization due to the conditional execution paradigm and delayed result
%writing in multiplication that cause most problems. These instructions serialize
%this out-of-order core in such a way that a lot of stalls occur, and the
%processor wastes energy while idling.


\subsection{Further Work}
Our results comes from completely synthetic benchmarks, and we do not yet know
how this would differ from real world workloads. The synthetic tests fill the
pipeline with equal instructions, while common workloads would at least contain
a few different instructions simultaneously.

The results was normalized according to numbers found in the CPU
datasheet. We believe that more informative results would emerge if the
performance counter data was used to adjust the measured current drain, rather
than number of cycles used. This is after all a multiple-issue pipelined
processor core.

Also, we have not yet dived into how instruction arguments affects the energy
usage on modern processors. We believe that instruction patterns that causes a
high degree of bit toggling would yield higher energy usage, due to the amount
of energy used to charge and release the transistors. A problem rising is the
fact that we do not know how the processor schedules or distributes the
different instructions, thus one has to be very careful when writing the
benchmarks.

When selecting instructions for our benchmarks, we have omitted the set of
floating-point instructions. This is because in the ARM Cortex-A9, the floating
point unit (NEON) is considered a co-processor\cite{armtech}, and thus out of
our scope. Investigating the energy efficiency of co-processors versus
processors that embed such functionality would add value to our results.

There are also room for improvements regarding the experimental setup.
Ultimately, one would like to be able to measure each instruction individually,
but according to the Nyquist-Shannon theorem\cite{shannon1949communication},
this would require a sampling rate of at least 3.4 GHz. We could not simply
go slower on the clock, as a clock frequency reduction will affect the
energy efficiency, possibly in the negative direction\cite{burd1995energy}.

Compilers, simulators and synthesis tools would benefit from this kind of
information, and one could possibly generate output that is more energy
optimized than currently available.
