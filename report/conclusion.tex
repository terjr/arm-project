This is where we will put the conclusion

\subsection{Further Work}

We have not yet dived into how instruction operands affects the energy usage on
modern processors. We would think that instruction patterns that causes a high
degree of bit toggling would yield higher energy usage, due to the amount of
TODO. However, writing valid benchmarks stressing these pattern is difficult on
modern architectures because of the out-of-order non-determinism.
