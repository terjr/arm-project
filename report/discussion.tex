\section{Discussion}
Here we will discuss some problems regarding this experiment. Some topics may be
the fact that sampling with 1kHz is not enough by a long shot to measure
independent instructions running at 1.7GHz, how much variations are inferred by
the power supply voltage being slightly unstable, how applicable is this
experiment to other architectures, and what kind of other applications can
benefit from this experiment (e.g.. simulation power consumption in GEM5). What
about Wattch (Works only with a 'no longer maintained' simulator).
