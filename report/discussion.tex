\section{Discussion}
Here we will discuss some problems regarding this experiment. Some topics may be the fact that sampling with 1kHz is not enough by a long shot to meassure independent instructions
running at 1.7GHz, how much variations are infered by the power supply voltage beeing slightly unstable, how applicable is this experiment to other architectures, and what kind
of other applications can benefit from this experiment (eg. simulation power consumption in GEM5). What about Wattch (Works only with a 'no longer maintained' simulator).
