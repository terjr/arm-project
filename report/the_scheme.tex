\section{ISA Dependent Energy Consumption}
% General approach here? Implementation in methodology? Order of appearance?

\todo[inline]{Give some background on what exactly burns energy in a processor.
Be as precise as possible -- dissect the pipeline.}
Since this paper investigates the ISA dependent power consumption, we do not
look into the details of components other that the CPU core. In some
architectures, cache and other components close to the core are driven by the
same supply rail\cite{rusu200765}. We try to disable or avoid usage of such
components as much as possible.


This method mainly focuses on comparison between instructions, and the energy
consumption of the condition calculation and the conditional jump can then be
seen as part of the common baseline.
\todo[inline]{Correct assumption? Probably. Explain why we need a baseline
instruction.}
