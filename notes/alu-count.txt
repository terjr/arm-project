We tried to figure out how many functional units there is in the Cortex-A9. We
figured out that 4x MUL (12 cycles) and 9x ADD (9 cycles) in fast-loop used 50
cycles (accurate). Performance counters from main and secondary execution unit
said 44 and 47, respectively.

For each iteration, you would have
9 cycles to add
12 cycles to mul
1 cycle to sub
=22

Multiplied with 5, you get
45
60
5
=110

BUT IT TAKES ONLY 50 CYCLES.
