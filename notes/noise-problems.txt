When we increased the number of meassurements from ~10 to 10,000 a second,
we discovered a strange 50Hz 40mVptp component in our datasets.
After a lot of trial and error, we discovered that this noise derived from
the large transformer in the core power supply (big Agilent PSU on the HW-lab).
The remedy was to put the power supply on the floor, while the shunt resistor
was placed on the table. (Initially, they stood right next to each other).
