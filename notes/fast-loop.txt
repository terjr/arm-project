- Would like to measure without the influence of caches
- Run 15 instructions in fast-loop (TM)(R)(C). Only room for "less than 64
  bytes" of instructions, that is 60 / (4 byte instructions) = 15 instructions.
- Used {,no-}icache.asm {,no-}fast-loop.asm to figure out how many instructions
  we had space for.
- Instructions also has to be cache aligned, although not documented by ARM.
  Used ".align" in the assembly.
- NOTE: To start with, we forgot to align to the next 64byte boundary.
